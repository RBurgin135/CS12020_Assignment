# CS12020_Assignment

This is my submission for my assignment for the Introduction to Programming module for my first year of university. I received an overall mark of 92% for this work. 

The work is written in Arduino C. The task for the assignment was to interface with the robotic shield they gave us and make the arduino move along some lines printed on A4 paper. This was done using the shield's wheels and the LDR's on the front; the LDR's ability to recognise the stark black line on the paper compared with the white was used to navigate it along the track. The arduino is also capable of avoiding obstacles in the track using the infrared sensor on the front of the shield. The final task was for the arduino to be able to read 'barcodes' drawn onto the track to dictate whether to turn left or right. The solution I created accomplishes all of these.
